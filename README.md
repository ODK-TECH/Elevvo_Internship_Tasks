This repository documents a series of machine learning tasks completed during the Elevvo Internship. The projects encompass supervised and unsupervised learning, time series forecasting, and computer vision applications, utilizing real-world datasets and industry best practices.

📂 Tasks
🔹 Level 1

Task 1: Student Score Prediction
Predict student GPA from demographics, study habits, parental involvement, and extracurricular activities.

Task 2: Customer Segmentation
Apply clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

Bonus Task 1: Student Score Prediction (Extended)
A variation of Task 1 with extended feature engineering and evaluation.

🔹 Level 2

Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction
Build classification models to predict whether a loan application will be approved, based on applicant financial and demographic data.

🔹 Level 3

Task 7: Sales Forecasting (Time Series)
Perform sales forecasting using rolling averages, seasonal decomposition, and advanced ML models (XGBoost/LightGBM) with time-aware validation.

🔹 Industry-Level Task

Task 8: Traffic Sign Recognition
